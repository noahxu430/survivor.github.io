## Intro

Survivor is a reality-competition television franchise produced in many countries around the world. The show "Survivor" **sends a group of contestants (usually 16 to 20 people) to a remote or deserted location. There, they are divided into two or more tribes, each of which must find food, water, and shelter on their own while participating in various challenges.** The American version of Survivor has 46 seasons since its launch in 2000.
